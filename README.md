## Learn more

This library was motivated and designed over the course of many episodes on
[Point-Free](https://www.pointfree.co), a video series exploring advanced programming topics in the
Swift language, hosted by [Brandon Williams](https://twitter.com/mbrandonw) and
[Stephen Celis](https://twitter.com/stephencelis). To support the continued development of this
library, [subscribe today](https://www.pointfree.co/pricing).

## Overview

SharingGRDB is lightweight replacement for SwiftData and the `@Query` macro that deploys all the way
back to the iOS 13 generation of targets.

<table>
<tr>
<th>SharingGRDB</th>
<th>SwiftData</th>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=415>
      
```swift
@SharedReader(
  .fetchAll(
    sql: "SELECT * FROM items"
  )
)
var items: [Item]
```

</td>
<td width=415>

```swift
@Query
var items: [Item]
```

</td>
</tr>
</table>

Both of the above examples fetch items from an external data store, and both are automatically
observed by SwiftUI so that views are recomputed when the external data changes, but SharingGRDB is
powered directly by SQLite using [Sharing][sharing-gh] and [GRDB][grdb], and is
usable from UIKit, `@Observable` models, and more.

> Note: It is not required to write queries as a raw SQL string, and a query builder can be used 
> instead. For more information on SharingGRDB's querying capabilities, see 
[Fetching model data][fetching-article].

## Quick start

Before SharingGRDB's property wrappers can fetch data from SQLite, you need to provide–at
runtime–the default database it should use. This is typically done as early as possible in your
app's lifetime, like the app entry point in SwiftUI, and is analogous to configuring model storage
in SwiftData:

<table>
<tr>
<th>SharingGRDB</th>
<th>SwiftData</th>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=415>

```swift
@main
struct MyApp: App {
  init() {
    prepareDependencies {
      let db = try! DatabaseQueue(
        // Create/migrate a database 
        // connection
      )
      $0.defaultDatabase = db
    }
  }
  // ...
}
```

</td>
<td width=415>

```swift
@main
struct MyApp: App {
  let container = { 
    // Create/configure a container
    try! ModelContainer(/* ... */)
  }()
  
  var body: some Scene {
    WindowGroup {
      ContentView()
        .modelContainer(container)
    }
  }
}
```

</td>
</tr>
</table>

> Note: For more information on preparing a SQLite database, see 
[Preparing a SQLite database][preparing-db-article].

This `defaultDatabase` connection is used implicitly by SharingGRDB's strategies, like 
 [`fetchAll`][fetchall-docs]:

```swift
@SharedReader(.fetchAll(sql: "SELECT * FROM items"))
var items: [Item]
```

And you can access this database throughout your application in a way similar to how one accesses
a model context, via a property wrapper:

<table>
<tr>
<th>SharingGRDB</th>
<th>SwiftData</th>
</tr>
<tr valign=top>
<td width=415>

```swift
@Dependency(\.defaultDatabase) 
var database
    
var newItem = Item(/* ... */)
try database.write { db in
  try newItem.insert(db)
}
```

</td>
<td width=415>

```swift
@Environment(\.modelContext) 
var modelContext
    
let newItem = Item(/* ... */)
modelContext.insert(newItem)
try modelContext.save()
```

</td>
</tr>
</table>

## SQLite knowledge required

SQLite is one of the 
 [most established and widely distributed](https://www.sqlite.org/mostdeployed.html) pieces of 
software in the history of software. Knowledge of SQLite is a great skill for any app developer to
have, and this library does not want to conceal it from you. So, we feel that to best wield this
library you should be familiar with the basics of SQLite, including schema design and normalization,
SQL queries, including joins and aggregates, and performance, including indices.

With some basic knowledge you can apply this library to your database schema in order to query
for data and keep your views up-to-date when data in the database changes. You can use GRDB's
[query builder][query-interface] APIs to query your database, or you can use raw SQL queries, 
along with all of the power that SQL has to offer.

## Demos

This repo comes with _lots_ of examples to demonstrate how to solve common and complex problems with
Sharing. Check out [this](./Examples) directory to see them all, including:

  * [Case Studies](./Examples/CaseStudies):
    A number of case studies demonstrating the built-in features of the library.

  * [SyncUps](./Examples/SyncUps): We also rebuilt Apple's [Scrumdinger][scrumdinger] demo
    application using modern, best practices for SwiftUI development, including using this library
    to query and persist state using SQLite.
    
  * [Reminders](./Examples/Reminders): A rebuild of Apple's [Reminders][reminders-app-store] app
    that uses a SQLite database to model the reminders, lists and tags. It features many advanced
    queries, such as searching, and stats aggregation.

## Installation

You can add SharingGRDB to an Xcode project by adding it to your project as a package.

> https://github.com/pointfreeco/sharing-grdb

If you want to use SharingGRDB in a [SwiftPM](https://swift.org/package-manager/) project, it's as
simple as adding it to your `Package.swift`:

``` swift
dependencies: [
  .package(url: "https://github.com/pointfreeco/sharing-grdb", from: "0.1.0")
]
```

And then adding the product to any target that needs access to the library:

```swift
.product(name: "SharingGRDB", package: "sharing-grdb"),
```
