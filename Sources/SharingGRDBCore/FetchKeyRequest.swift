import GRDB

/// A type that can request a value from a database.
///
/// This type can be used to describe a transaction to read data from SQLite:
///
/// ```swift
/// struct PlayersRequest: FetchKeyRequest {
///   struct Value {
///     let injuredPlayerCount: Int
///     let players: [Player]
///   }
///
///   func fetch(_ db: Database) throws -> Value {
///     try Value(
///       injuredPlayerCount: Player
///         .where(\.isInjured)
///         .fetchCount(db),
///       players: Player
///         .where { !$0.isInjured }

///         .limit(10)
///         .fetchAll(db)
///     )
///   }

/// ```
///
/// And then can be used with a `@SharedReader` and
/// ``Sharing/SharedReaderKey/fetch(_:database:animation:)-rgj4`` to popular state in a SwiftUI
/// view, `@Observable` model, UIKit view controller, and more:
///
/// ```swift
/// struct PlayersView: View {
///   @SharedReader(.fetch(PlayersRequest())) var response
///
///   var body: some View {
///     ForEach(response.players) { player in
///       // ...
///     }
///     Button("View injured players (\(response.injuredPlayerCount))") {
