# ``SharingGRDBCore``

A fast, lightweight replacement for SwiftData, powered by SQL. This module is automatically imported
when you `import SharingGRDB`.

## Overview

SharingGRDB is a [fast](#Performance), lightweight replacement for SwiftData that deploys all the
way back to the iOS 13 generation of targets.

@Row {
  @Column {
    ```swift
    // SharingGRDB
    @FetchAll
    var items: [Item]

    @Table
    struct Item {
      let id: Int
      var title = ""
      var isInStock = true
      var notes = ""
    }
    ```
  }
  @Column {
    ```swift
    // SwiftData
    @Query
    var items: [Item]

    @Model
    class Item {
      var title: String
      var isInStock: Bool
      var notes: String
      init(
        title: String = "",
        isInStock: Bool = true,
        notes: String = ""
      ) {
        self.title = title
        self.isInStock = isInStock
        self.notes = notes
      }
    }
    ```
  }
}

Both of the above examples fetch items from an external data store using Swift data types, and both
are automatically observed by SwiftUI so that views are recomputed when the external data changes,
but SharingGRDB is powered directly by SQLite using [Sharing](#What-is-Sharing),
[StructuredQueries](#What-is-StructuredQueries), and [GRDB](#What-is-GRDB), and is usable from
anywhere, including UIKit, `@Observable` models, and more.

## Quick start

Before SharingGRDB's property wrappers can fetch data from SQLite, you need to provide---at
runtime---the default database it should use. This is typically done as early as possible in your
app's lifetime, like the app entry point in SwiftUI, and is analogous to configuring model storage
in SwiftData:

@Row {
  @Column {
    ```swift
    // SharingGRDB
    @main
    struct MyApp: App {
      init() {
        prepareDependencies {
          // Create/migrate a database connection
          let db = try! DatabaseQueue(/* ... */)
          $0.defaultDatabase = db
        }
      }
      // ...
    }
    ```
  }
  @Column {
    ```swift
    // SwiftData
    @main
    struct MyApp: App {
      let container = { 
        // Create/configure a container
        try! ModelContainer(/* ... */)
      }()
      
      var body: some Scene {
        WindowGroup {
          ContentView()
            .modelContainer(container)
        }
      }
    }
    ```
  }
}

> Note: For more information on preparing a SQLite database, see <doc:PreparingDatabase>.

This `defaultDatabase` connection is used implicitly by SharingGRDB's strategies, like 
[`@FetchAll`](<doc:SharingGRDBCore/FetchAll>), which are similar to SwiftData's
`@Query` macro, but more powerful:

@Row {
  @Column {
    ```swift
    @FetchAll
    var items: [Item]

    @FetchAll(Item.order(by: \.title))
    var items

    @FetchAll(Item.where(\.isInStock))
    var items

    @FetchOne(Item.count())
    var inStockItemsCount = 0
    ```
  }
  @Column {
    ```swift
    @Query
    var items: [Item]

    @Query(sort: [SortDescriptor(\.title)])
    var items: [Item]

    // No @Query equivalent of filtering
    // by 'isInStock: Bool'

    // No @Query equivalent of counting
    // entries in database without loading
    // all entries.
    ```
  }
}

And you can access this database throughout your application in a way similar to how one accesses
a model context, via a property wrapper:

@Row {
  @Column {
    ```swift
    // SharingGRDB
    @Dependency(\.defaultDatabase) var database
    
    try database.write { db in
      try Item.insert(Item(/* ... */))
        .execute(db)
    }
    ```
  }
  @Column {
    ```swift
    // SwiftData
    @Environment(\.modelContext) var modelContext
    
    let newItem = Item(/* ... */)
    modelContext.insert(newItem)
    try modelContext.save()
    ```
  }
}

This is all you need to know to get started with SharingGRDB, but there's much more to learn. Read
the [articles](#Essentials) below to learn how to best utilize this library.

## Performance

SharingGRDB leverages high-performance decoding from
[StructuredQueries](https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-structured-queries) to turn fetched data
into your Swift domain types, and has a performance profile similar to invoking SQLite's C APIs
directly.

See the following benchmarks against
[Lighter's performance test suite](https://github.com/Lighter-swift/PerformanceTestSuite) for a
taste of how it compares:

```
Orders.fetchAll                          setup    rampup   duration
  SQLite (generated by Enlighter 1.4.10) 0        0.144    7.183
  Lighter (1.4.10)                       0        0.164    8.059
  SharingGRDB (0.2.0)                    0        0.172    8.511
  GRDB (7.4.1, manual decoding)          0        0.376    18.819
  SQLite.swift (0.15.3, manual decoding) 0        0.564    27.994
  SQLite.swift (0.15.3, Codable)         0        0.863    43.261
  GRDB (7.4.1, Codable)                  0.002    1.07     53.326
```

## SQLite knowledge required

SQLite is one of the 
[most established and widely distributed](https://www.sqlite.org/mostdeployed.html) pieces of
software in the history of software. Knowledge of SQLite is a great skill for any app developer to
have, and this library does not want to conceal it from you. So, we feel that to best wield this
library you should be familiar with the basics of SQLite, including schema design and normalization,
SQL queries, including joins and aggregates, and performance, including indices.

With some basic knowledge you can apply this library to your database schema in order to query
for data and keep your views up-to-date when data in the database changes, and you can use
[StructuredQueries](https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-structured-queries) to build queries,
either using its type-safe, discoverable query building APIs, or using its `#sql` macro for writing
safe SQL strings.

## What is Sharing?

[Sharing](https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-sharing) is a universal and extensible solution for
sharing your app's model data across features and with external systems, such as user defaults,
the file system, and more. This library builds upon the tools from Sharing in order to allow for
the [fetching](<doc:Fetching>) and [observing](<doc:Observing>) of data in a SQLite database.

This is all you need to know about Sharing to hit the ground running with SharingGRDB, but it only
scratches the surface of what the library makes possible. It can also act as a replacement to
SwiftUI's `@AppStorage` that works with UIKit and `@Observable` models, and can be integrated
with custom persistence strategies. To learn more, check out
[the documentation](https://swiftpackageindex.com/pointfreeco/swift-sharing/~/documentation/sharing/).

## What is StructuredQueries?

[StructuredQueries](https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-structured-queries) is a library for
building SQL in a safe, expressive, and composable manner, and decoding results with high
performance. Learn more about designing schemas and building queries with the library by seeing its
[documentation](https://swiftpackageindex.com/pointfreeco/swift-structured-queries/~/documentation/structuredqueriescore/).

SharingGRDB contains an official StructuredQueries driver that connects it to SQLite _via_ GRDB,
though its query builder and decoder are general purpose tools that can interface with other
databases (MySQL, Postgres, _etc._) and database libraries.

## What is GRDB?

[GRDB](https://github.com/groue/GRDB.swift) is a popular Swift interface to SQLite with a rich
feature set and
[extensive documentation](https://swiftpackageindex.com/groue/GRDB.swift/documentation/grdb).
This library leverages GRDB's' observation APIs to keep the `@FetchAll`, `@FetchOne`, and `@Fetch`
property wrappers in sync with the database and update SwiftUI views.

If you're already familiar with SQLite, GRDB provides thin APIs that can be leveraged with raw SQL
in short order. If you're new to SQLite, GRDB offers a great introduction to a highly portable
database engine. We recommend
([as does GRDB](https://github.com/groue/GRDB.swift?tab=readme-ov-file#documentation)) a familiarity
with SQLite to take full advantage of GRDB and SharingGRDB.
