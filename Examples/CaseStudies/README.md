# Case Studies

This project includes a number of digestible examples of how to solve common problems using 
SharingGRDB, including:

  * [Animations](Animations.swift): Shows how to animate changes when the database changes and 
    updates state in features.
  * [Dynamic Queries](DynamicQuery.swift): Shows how to dynamic change the parameters of a SQL
    query, such as when searching for rows in a table that contains a fragment of text.
  * [@Observable Models](ObservableModelDemo.swift): Shows how to use the tools of this library
    in an `@Observable` model.
  * [SwiftUI](SwiftUIDemo.swift): Shows how to use the tools of this library directly in a SwiftUI
    view.
  * [Database Transactions](TransactionDemo.swift): Shows how to execute multiple queries within
    a single database transaction in order to fetch data for a feature.
  * [UIKit](UIKitDemo.swift): Shows how to use the tools of this library in a UIKit view controller.
